Thank you for your work. But before I can add it to the project, please be
sure if you have met two requirements.

1. Please provide a description of your changes here. If it is only a text
   correction, you can write "fix a typo". But if you want to add a patch to
   a Wine version or add a new one, please provide a lot more information: why
   you want to add it, what it changes, etc. Generally, in that situation, more
   information will help to speed up the process of accepting the request.

2. If you want to add a patch to existing Wine version or a new version of
   Wine, please provide link to the successful GitHub action used to build it.
   I mean the same action which is used here in the project to build Wine.
